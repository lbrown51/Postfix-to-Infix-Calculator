Description:
This is a postfix to infix calculator. It uses to stacks and queues to rearrange numbers. 
It also makes me sad because it doesnt work that well. I thought that I had done the rearrangement correctly, but I'm sure that I'm messing it up. My evaluation compensates for that slightly, but only for non paren functions.

Zip includes: mainProject2, InfixToPostFix, Queue, QueueInterface, QueueNode, Stack, StackInterface, StackNode. 
Compile instructions : 
javac * java 
java mainProject2
